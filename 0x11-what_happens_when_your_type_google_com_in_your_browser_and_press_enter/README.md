## Introduction

This project is an exploration of the fundamental components and processes involved when you type "google.com" into your web browser and hit Enter. It provides a detailed breakdown of the journey from a simple user action to the loading of a web page. By understanding the inner workings of web browsing, you gain insights into key technologies and concepts such as DNS, TCP/IP, firewalls, encryption (HTTPS/SSL), load balancers, web servers, application servers, and databases.

## Project Overview

Web browsing seems effortless, but beneath the surface, numerous systems collaborate to deliver web content securely and efficiently. In this project, we dissect the entire process step by step:

1. **DNS Request:** Explains what DNS (Domain Name System) is, its role, how it converts domain names to IP addresses, and the importance of DNS in web browsing.

2. **TCP/IP:** Covers the basics of TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol), describing how they are used to establish connections with servers.

3. **Firewall:** Explores the protective barrier guarding your device from malicious traffic.

4. **HTTPS/SSL:** Investigates the encryption methods ensuring secure data transfer.

5. **Load-Balancer:** Discusses the role of load balancers in distributing traffic efficiently.

6. **Web Server:** Uncovers how web servers handle incoming requests.

7. **Application Server:** Analyzes the generation of dynamic web pages by application servers.

8. **Database:** Peers into the databases that store and retrieve data for web applications.

The project aims to provide clear, concise, and informative explanations for each component and process, enhancing your understanding of web technology.

## Technologies Used
