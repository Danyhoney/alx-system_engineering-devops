# Web Stack Debugging

This project encompasses various tasks focused on the art of debugging web stacks. Debugging is a vital skill for any web developer or system administrator. In this project, we dive into debugging techniques for resolving web stack issues, including configuration problems, performance bottlenecks, and more.

## Tasks To Complete

+ [x] 0. Sky is the Limit, Let's Bring That Limit Higher
  - The first task involves addressing a challenge in our web server setup, featuring Nginx. Under load testing, our server is struggling, with a significant number of failed requests. To simulate this, we utilize ApacheBench, a widely-used tool for simulating HTTP requests to a web server. We send 2000 requests to our server with 100 requests at a time and observe 943 requests failing. The goal is to optimize our stack to reduce the number of failed requests to zero.
  - Debugging is a fundamental skill, especially when things go wrong. In this task, you'll explore and understand the intricacies of your web stack, leveraging logs and various debugging techniques to identify and resolve performance issues.

+ [x] 1. User Limit
  - The second task revolves around modifying the OS configuration to enable smooth login with the `holberton` user and open files without encountering error messages.
  - Debugging is not limited to the application layer; it extends to the system and server configurations. In this task, you'll delve into system-level debugging and fine-tuning to ensure a seamless user experience and optimal system performance.

Debugging is an art that requires a combination of skills, including problem-solving, attention to detail, and a deep understanding of the technologies and tools at your disposal. Whether you're dealing with application-level bugs or system-level issues, debugging is a critical aspect of maintaining a robust and reliable web stack.
